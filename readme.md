## Data

The data is is from Rachael Tatman at Kaggle.

## Running the code

This uses a [taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) and docker to help manage the environment. This allows one to easily move the code into production on a server or share it with coworkers without having to reconfigure anything. :)
